**to create the caching system:
  - if a page is requested with no cached configuration file the cache configuration dumping will be enabled at the end of the request, before the page is rendered
  - the configuration file is parsed into a PHP array then exported into a file
  - the file is then saved into the cache folder with a application specific folder
    + {LIBRARY}/cache/[APP-NAME]
  ^concept: create a page/request/url specific cofiguration file
  
**to use the cache config:
  - the cached configuration of the requested page is first check if it exists
    + true:  the configuration files will then be included in the request
    + false: the cache configuration dumping will be enabled and the cache config loading will be aborted
